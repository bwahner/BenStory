Oh, there once was a hero named Ragnar the Red
Who came riding to Whiterun from ole Rorikstead

And the braggart did swagger and brandish his blade
As he told of bold battles and gold he had made

But then he went quiet, did Ragnar the Red
When he met the shieldmaiden, Matilda, who said:

"Oh you talk, and you lie, and you drink all our mead
Now I think it's high time that you lie down and bleed"

And so then came clashing and slashing of steel
As the brave lass Matilda charged in full of zeal

And the braggart named Ragnar was boastful no more
When his ugly red head rolled around on the floor

Matilda felt accomplished and took the Daedric heart right
out of Ragnar

She tried to join The Dark Brotherhood but could not because
she is a woman

On the way back to her castle, she took an arrow to the knee
and cried into the night, with her dog named steve
